# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>5 Found Instances</summary>

	    function setMinimalBet(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/F3BlackJack.sol [Line: 42](src/F3BlackJack.sol#L42)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.22;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

## L-4: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-5: Uninitialized Local Variable

Initialize all the variables. If a variable is meant to be initialized to zero, explicitly set it to zero to improve code readability.

## L-6: Costly operations inside loop

Invoking `SSTORE` operations in loops may waste gas. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.
